                    <h5 class="about-australia_title">The Mystique of Malaysia</h5>
                    <p>Until 2004, Malaysia was the unlikely home of the world's tallest buildings, a distinction that
                        says
                        just as much about this small country in Southeast Asia as it does about the region as a whole.
                        Located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's bustling, exciting capital city of nearly 1.5 million
                        residents,
                        the Petronas Towers soar nearly 1,500 feet above the ground. And on top of their sheer height,
                        the
                        architectural design of them, conceived to reflect the nature of the local Muslim culture, is an
                        achievement in itself. Students considering Malaysia study abroad programs face amazing journeys
                        in
                        a country of wonder.</p>
                    <p>Most impressive of all, however, is what the Petronas Towers stand for: The heralding of South
                        East
                        Asia as one of the single most important economic regions on the planet. South East Asia has
                        seen an
                        economic and political resurgence the likes of which the world has never really experienced
                        before.
                        The twin towers of Kuala Lumpur, found in Malaysia, stand as the symbol of that ascendance.</p>
                    <p>The city itself is an exciting amalgam of the past, the present, and the future. One of the most
                        telling examples of this happy coexistence is the juxtaposition of the supremely modern and the
                        astoundingly ancient. From the truly dramatic architecture of Kuala Lumpur's city center to the
                        ancient Batu Caves just north of the city, the best of both worlds exist together in this
                        country.</p>

            <div class="about-australia_title">
                Malaysia Study Abroad Students
            </div>
            <p>Students in the capital city will find themselves in the heart of one of the most exciting, up-and-coming
                urban centers in the region. As a result, they will enjoy international cuisine, a bustling nightlife,
                other students from all over the world, and a culture as stimulating and as exciting as any they are
                likely to encounter abroad.</p>
            <p>In terms of nightlife, which is key to any college student's experience, "Kuala Lumpur has the most
                upbeat nightlife scene in Malaysia. Dining out and a night at the pubs or discotheques are regular
                activities for city residents, and entertainment venues are virtually around every street corner. There
                are also concentrated pockets which can almost be classified as entertainment districts." This, of
                course, is of tremendous benefit when it comes to relaxing after all the rigors of the classroom that
                students in Malaysia are sure to experience.</p>
            <p>Outside of the city itself, there are too many things to see and do for a college student to ever
                experience them all. From the beaches of the Malaysian islands to the outdoor and water activities that
                so enthrall tourists and residents alike, there is something in this country for everyone.</p>
            <div class="about-australia_title">
                Learning Malay Language With Malaysia Study Abroad Programs
            </div>
            <p>Students searching for Malaysia study abroad programs, of course, may find themselves a bit intimidated
                by the prospect of having to learn the Malay language, but they needn't be: It is really no more
                difficult to learn than any other language, and immersion in a country in which it is spoken is sure to
                make understanding it and communicating in it much easier than you may fear. And because it is so
                similar to the Indonesian language, and its use is so widespread through Southeast Asia (including some
                people in Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines), a working knowledge of it will take you far in your
                travels and work throughout the region. However, with a little bit of practice, the ways of life of the
                Malaysian people will come to seem like second-nature to you.</p>
            <p>Culturally, Malaysia is quite different from the United States. Many of its social customs are based on
                Muslim traditions, and as such, relations between the sexes may seem a bit more restrained than they do
                in the United States. For example, "Although handshakes are generally acceptable for both men and women,
                some Muslim ladies may acknowledge introductions to gentlemen by merely nodding and smiling. A handshake
                should only be initiated by ladies. The traditional greeting or Salam resembles a handshake with both
                hands but without the grasp. The man offers both hands, lightly touches his friends outstretched hands,
                and then brings his hands to his chest to mean, 'I greet you from my heart.' The visitor should
                reciprocate the Salam."</p>
            <p>In the end, Malaysia is an excellent place to attend college not only because of its rich history and
                fascinating culture, but also because of the ever-increasing importance of the region itself. And the
                more you can integrate yourself into it now, and the more contacts you make, the more likely you will be
                to eventually play a roll in the business dealings of it once you're finished with college. All told,
                then, studying in Malaysia will likely provide you with everything most students desire from their
                education.</p>
