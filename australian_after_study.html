                Graduate Work Visas – Visa Subclass 485
                Students may be eligible for graduate work visas on completion of their courses. This gives them full work rights in Australia for 18 months or more and makes it easier to accumulate more points when applying for skilled migration or to search for an employer sponsor. This visa has two main categories:

                Post-Study Work Stream
                This visa is for international students who graduate with a higher education degree from an Australian education provider, irrespective of their field of study. Visa in this stream can be granted for up to four years depending on the qualification achieved.

                Graduate Work Stream
                This visa is for international students who graduate with skills and qualifications that relate to the occupations on the Skilled Occupation List (SOL). In this stream, 18 months of temporary residency visa is granted to students from the date of grant.</p>
            <div class="about-australia_title">
                Training and Research Visa (SC 402)
            </div>
            <p>Occupational Trainee, Professional Development, Research Streams

                This visa allows you to take part in structured workplace-based training to enhance your skills in your current occupation, area of tertiary study, or field of expertise, participate in a professional development training program in Australia, or observe or participate in an Australian research project after being invited to do so.</p>
            <div class="about-australia_title">
                General Skilled Migration – Visa Subclass 189,190 or 489
            </div>
            <p>This is a points based skilled migration program and you may be eligible to apply for this visa by submitting an expression of interest (EoI). Following this, you will be invited by Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP) through SkillSelect to apply for Permanent Residency.

                International students have a number of advantages in applying for skilled migration. Points are available for studies in Australia, particularly where completing higher qualifications or studying in a regional area. In addition, having an Australian qualification makes it easier to pass skills assessment in a skilled occupation.</p>
            <div class="about-australia_title">
                Employer Sponsored – Visa Subclass 457,186 or 187
            </div>
            <p>Based on the eligibility criteria, if one has a job offer from an Australian company and the company is willing to sponsor, then it will be advisable to opt for Employer sponsored temporary or permanent residency visa.</p>

            <div class="about-australia_title">
                Partner Migration – Visa Subclass 820 and 801
            </div>
            <p>If you have an Australian spouse, partner or are in a relationship, it is possible for them to sponsor you for permanent residency. Your partner would need to be an Australian permanent resident, citizen or eligible New Zealand citizen.

                Important Note: Only registered migration agents can legally give immigration assistance in Australia. To perform this work, they must be listed on the Register of Migration Agents held by the Office of the Migration Agents Registration Authority (MARA). If you wish to discuss on the above or any other visa options, then you need to get professional consultation with our Registered Migration Agent (RMA) through our Migration Team.

                Wherever your path leads, take consideration of joining alumni group from your institution. It will facilitate you to stay in touch with your classmates, and can provide you with great benefits and opportunities along with information that are of importance in the future.
